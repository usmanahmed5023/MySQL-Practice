# Database Revision with MySQL

This repository contains practice exercises and SQL scripts for revising **MySQL Database Concepts**.  
Each topic is practiced in a **separate `.sql` file**.  
In addition, I have also created a **Relational Database Model (RDM)** and an **ERD Diagram** for a **Vaccination Management System**.

## üéØ Objectives
- Revise core MySQL commands and concepts.
- Practice database manipulation and querying.
- Understand and apply different types of **joins**.
- Learn **constraints, keys, and database objects**.
- Implement **Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)**.
- Develop **ERD** and **Relational Data Model (RDM)**.
- Prepare for viva by understanding each topic in depth.
- Design and represent **Vaccination Management System** using **ERD** and **RDM**.

## üè• Vaccination Management System
- Designed a **Relational Database Model (RDM)**.  
- Created an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**.  
- Covers entities like **Users, Roles, Admin, Health Workers, Citizens, Vaccines, Vaccination Records, and Districts**.  
- Helps in understanding how database design is applied to **real-world systems**.
